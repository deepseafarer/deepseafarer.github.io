# Token analysis

When evaluating tokens it is often useful to ask these questions:
- Good project? Use cases and competitors?
- What are its revenue streams?
- Good team? Any doxxed members?
- Public sentiment?
- What are the buy and sell pressures of the token?
- Is the distribution of the token concentrated?
- How does the token accrue value?
- What is the emission schedule?
- What is the unlock/vesting schedule for early investors?
- What is the market cap and FDV of the token?
- Potential risks?
- What exchanges are the token listed on?

### $LUNA (Terra)

#### Tokenomics
The tokenomics of $LUNA is tied with its use to stabilise stablecoins like $UST, $EUT and $KRT in the Terra ecosystem. These stablecoins are algorithmic and are not backed by any collateral. 1 $UST is minted by exchanging $1 worth of $LUNA at the Terra treasury. Conversely, $1 worth of $LUNA can be obtained by exchanging 1 $UST at the treasury. Before the Columbus-5 upgrade, $LUNA that is used to mint $UST (i.e. seigniorage) is mostly channeled into the Terra community pool to be used for funding new projects, with a portion of it being burnt. After Columbus-5, all the $LUNA used to mint $UST is burnt instead.

$UST is able to maintain its peg with the help of arbitrageurs. When 1 $UST falls below $1 (e.g. $0.95), arbitrageurs can purchase 1 $UST at $0.95 and exchange it for $1 worth of $LUNA, which they can sell for $1. When 1 $UST rises above $1 (e.g. $1.05), arbitrageurs can purchase $1 worth of $LUNA and exchange it for 1 $UST, which they can sell for $1.05.

In addition to the use of $LUNA to stabilise Terra stablecoins, Terra ecosytem validators are required to stake $LUNA to secure the Terra proof of stake (PoS) blockchain. However, unlike other blockchains where validators are rewarded with both newly minted tokens (e.g. $SOL, $AVAX) and transaction fees, Terra validators are only rewarded with transaction fees. As Terra transaction fees are normally received in the form of Terra stablecoins ($UST, $KRT), validators receive these rewards instead. Most importantly, this means that no new $LUNA is being emitted to reward stakers, unlike other PoS blockchains.

#### Distribution
The supply of $LUNA is only affected by the demand for Terra stablecoins. The maximum supply of $LUNA was set at one billion, but was distributed at genesis with the following allocations: Terraform Labs (10%), Employees & Contributor Pool (20%), Terra Alliance (20%), Stability Reserves (20%), Genesis liquidity (4%), Investors (26%).

### $JEWEL (Defi Kingdoms)

#### Distribution
Quantity of pre-mint was 10M $JEWEL, with most of it allocated to funding the development of Defi Kingdoms. By January 2022, over half of the maximum supply of $JEWEL would have been emitted, however, roughly 75% of $JEWEL will remain locked. The time at which the liquidity mining rewards are harvested determines the percentage of locked and unlocked $JEWEL received. The percentage of unlocked $JEWEL received starts at 5% at epoch 1 (August 2021) and increases by 2% every epoch (i.e. every week).
