# Token analysis

When evaluating tokens it is often useful to ask these questions:
- Good project? Use cases and competitors?
- What are its revenue streams?
- Good team? Any doxxed members?
- Public sentiment?
- What are the buy and sell pressures of the token?
- Is the distribution of the token concentrated?
- How does the token accrue value?
- What is the emission schedule?
- What is the unlock/vesting schedule for early investors?
- What is the market cap and FDV of the token?
- Potential risks?
- What exchanges are the token listed on?
