#### What is the mempool?
The mempool is a set of broadcasted transactions that have not been added into the blockchain. Miners decide which transactions to validate and include in the block, and often select transactions with higher fees.

#### How do I transfer cryptocurrency to the Polygon sidechain?
The easiest way is to first add the Polygon Mainnet on your Metamask wallet. Please do so by following the instructions [here](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask). After doing so, use the [Polygon bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge) to transfer your assets on the Ethereum blockchain over to the Polygon blockchain. Be careful when choosing any blockchain bridge to transfer your assets, as some bridges may be vulnerable to hacks or are malicious!

#### What is wETH?
wETH is short for wrapped ETH, and is different from the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, Ether (ETH). wETH is ERC20 compatible, which allows it to be handled by smart contracts. Many decentralized applications (dApps) use wETH in place of ETH, so care should be taken to note which token you are dealing with.
