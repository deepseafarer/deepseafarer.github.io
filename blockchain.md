#### What is the mempool?
The mempool is a set of broadcasted transactions that have not been added into the blockchain. Miners decide which transactions to validate and include in the block, and often select transactions with higher fees.

#### What is wETH?
wETH is short for wrapped ETH, and is different from the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, Ether (ETH). wETH is ERC20 compatible, which allows it to be handled by smart contracts. Many decentralized applications (dApps) use wETH in place of ETH, so care should be taken to note which token you are dealing with.
