# Yield farming

#### What is yield farming?
Yield farming is a catch-all term referring to the practise of earning yields on cryptocurrency a user holds. It is similar to receiving interest on bank deposits. For cryptocurrency, yield can be received in terms of the cryptocurrency provided, or in terms of the protocol's native token. In particular, the practise of receiving a protocol's native token for providing liquidity to the protocol is known as liquidity mining.

#### What is liquidity mining?
Liquidity mining refers to the issuance of native tokens by protocols to liquidity providers (LPs). For example, LPs that deposit ETH-USDC to liquidity pools on Sushiswap are rewarded with the native token $SUSHI. Protocols typically issue tokens to incentivize people to provide liquidity to their liquidity pools. Issuance of tokens is commonly very high in the beginning as protocols seek to bootstrap liquity in early pools (i.e. incentivise people to start depositing cryptocurrency into a pool).

#### Where do yields in DeFi come from?
There are many types of yield in DeFi. It is important to identify how protocols generate yields (i.e. how protocols generate value) in order to decide whether they are sustainable or not. Below is a breakdown of the main types of yields in DeFi:
1. **Proof of stake**: Protocols issue rewards for stakers that stake cryptocurrency to validate the blockchain. E.g. ETH2.0
2. **Lending**: Borrowers pay interest for loans. E.g. Aave, Compound
3. **Protocol usage**: An excellent example is the trading fees that DEXs charge users. E.g. Uniswap, Sushiswap
4. **Protocol-issued incentives**: An excellent example would be liquidity mining, where protocols reward early liquidity providers (LPs) with native tokens. E.g. Compound
5. **Products and services**: Protocols sell financial products such as insurance or covered calls or puts. E.g. Nexus Mutual, Dopex

No. Depends on the maths behind the liquidity pools.
