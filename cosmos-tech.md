# Cosmos - Technical details

The Cosmos SDK allows developers to create application-specific blockchains that can natively interoperate with other blockchains easily. It provides developers with the consensus engine Tendermint Core, and is designed to be modular in nature. Cosmos SDK modules are composable, and most of them are open source. Developers are able to import modules easily, allowing them to build upon pre-existing modules. The Cosmos SDK is written in Golang.
