# Token analysis - DeFi

## $JEWEL (Defi Kingdoms)

### Tokenomics
Quantity of pre-mint was 10M $JEWEL, with most of it allocated to funding the development of Defi Kingdoms. By January 2022, over half of the maximum supply of $JEWEL would have been emitted, however, roughly 75% of circulating $JEWEL supply will remain locked. The time at which the liquidity mining rewards are harvested determines the percentage of locked and unlocked $JEWEL received. The percentage of unlocked $JEWEL received starts at 5% at epoch 1 (August 2021) and increases by 2% every epoch (i.e. every week). Locked $JEWEL is unable to be used for staking, LPing, purchasing of heroes and etc. Locked $JEWEL will begin unlocking ratably at Epoch 52 (~Q3 2022).

The $JEWEL token is used as an in-game currency for DeFi Kingdoms: Serendale (on the Harmony blockchain). It can be used to purchase Hero NFTs, in-game, mint new generation Heroes and etc. Secondly, $JEWEL can be staked to obtain $xJEWEL. Holders of $xJEWEL are entitled to a portion of fees from DFK: Serendale. This includes 33.3% of DEX trading fees and 10% of in-game transaction fees (e.g. Hero Summons, Hero sales and levelling up). Visit the [docs](https://docs.defikingdoms.com/how-defi-kingdoms-works/power-tokens) for a breakdown of how in-game transaction fees are apportioned. In addition, holders of $xJEWEL are entitled to governance votes on project decisions. Thirdly, $JEWEL is used as the gas token on the DFK Chain (i.e. Avax subnet).

- Circulating Supply: 76.2M (3/4/2022)

## $JOE (Trader Joe)

Trader Joe is the largest DEX on Avalanche by TVL. It has since expanded its services to include collaterised borrowing and launchpad services. Its main drivers of revenue are DEX trading fees and borrowing fees. Users of the DEX pay 0.3% trading fee per swap, of which 0.25% is paid to LP providers, while 0.05% is swapped for USDC and paid out to stakers of $sJOE.

### Tokenomics 
Token emissions will decline over time, and will cease in January 2024. By June 2022, 75% of the maximum supply of $JOE would have been emitted. Emitted tokens are distributed between LP providers (50%), treasury (20%), team (20%) and potential strategic investors (10%). 

There are three types of staking available for $JOE tokens. Firstly, $JOE tokens can be staked for $sJOE, which will entitle holders to earn fees in USDC. Secondly, $JOE tokens can be staked for $veJOE, which will help to boost $JOE rewards for LP providers. $veJOE is emitted linearly when $JOE is staked until a maximum amount, which is 10 times the amount of $JOE staked. Adding 5% of the current staked balance of $JOE in the $veJOE pool results in double rewards for 15 days. When $JOE is unstaked from the $veJOE pool, all accumulated $veJOE are burned. The entire balance of $veJOE is used to boost each LP pool the user provides for independently. The boost APR% depends on the ratio of $veJOE tokens to LP tokens. The higher this ratio, the higher the APR boost. Thirdly, $JOE can be staked for $rJOE, which is used to decide the amount of $AVAX allocated in the Rocket Joe launchpad. Similar to the $veJOE pool, $rJOE is emitted linearly. However, there is no maximum cap and $rJOE persists even after $JOE is unstaked. 100 $rJOE entitles the user to 1 $AVAX in allocation that is exchanged for newly launched tokens.

- Circulating Supply: 209M (3/4/2022)
