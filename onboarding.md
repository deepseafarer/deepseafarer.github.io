# On-boarding 

## Onboarding through FTX

### Funding your FTX account
1. Transfer SGD from DBS Multi-currency account to IBKR (Free)
2. Exchange SGD to USD
3. Transfer USD from IBKR to DBS Multi-currency account (Fee: 10SGD)
4. Transfer USD from DBS to FTX (Free)

* Alternative to step 3 would be to transfer USD from IBKR straight to FTX [[1]]. However, FTX may not accept deposits from accounts that do not share the same name with the user's FTX account.

## Bridging on-chain

For most EVM-compatible blockchains, the first step is to add the blockchain network you want to bridge to in Metamask. Take note of the public address format (i.e. wallet addresses) of the blockchain of interest to see whether it is the same as Ethereum! Be careful when choosing any blockchain bridge to transfer your assets, as some bridges may be vulnerable to hacks or are malicious!
