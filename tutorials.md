#### How do I transfer cryptocurrency to the Polygon sidechain?
The easiest way is to first add the Polygon Mainnet on your Metamask wallet. Please do so by following the instructions [here](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask). After doing so, use the [Polygon bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge) to transfer your assets on the Ethereum blockchain over to the Polygon blockchain. Be careful when choosing any blockchain bridge to transfer your assets, as some bridges may be vulnerable to hacks or are malicious!
