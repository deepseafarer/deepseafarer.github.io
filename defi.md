#### What are stablecoins?
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of fiat currencies such as the US dollar. Examples of stablecoins are Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), DAI and Binance USD (BUSD). Stablecoins must fulfil token standards of their respective L1 blockchain. For examples, stablecoins on the Ethereum blockchain are ERC-20 tokens. The same stablecoins are not transferrable across different L1 blockchains (i.e. cannot send USDC from an Ethereum wallet to a Solana wallet).
