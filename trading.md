# Trading

Excellent [blog post](https://cobie.substack.com/p/trading-the-metagame) by @cobie on how trading crypto in a bull run is similar to the different metas in a video game (e.g. Dota 2)! There is a constant pressure to identify the different metagames that are emerging and how to win in these evolving metagames!

## Metagames (examples)
- Flipping newly launched projects
    - Tracking new contracts deployed on mainnet/testnet
    - Tracking the "smart money"
- NFTs
    - Tracking "smart money" purchases on Nansen
    - Minting of rare Meebits by exploiting leaks on attributes
- Selling new token listings on CEX (API leaks)

### Capital rotation
- DeFi Summer 2020
- Bitcoin bull run 
- Ethereum bull run
- Dogcoins/memecoins mania
- NFT bull run
- L1 rotation trade
- $OHM forks
- GameFi

## Bet sizing

Everyone has their own approach to bet sizing, depending on their trading goals and risk appetite. In addition, different trading strategies call for different approaches to bet sizing. My personal approach to bet sizing would be to treat it as a function of expected value (EV), probability of loss and magnitude of loss. I've listed a few great tweets on bet sizing by more reputable people below.

## Golden rules
- Be sure of thesis for trade. Identify the edge that you are trading on (e.g. information asymmetry).
- Consider EV and risk/reward ratio of trade
- Be mindful of market stage and macro conditions
- Always be dumping. Even if you have a long-term thesis on a token, sell partially into exuberance in order to buy back when the hype has subsided. If not, always take profits in majors
- Always be early. "The exceptional investor invests in heretical themes, and sells once those themes become orthodox. The average investor invests in orthodox themes, and sells once those themes become irrelevant." *- Arthur Hayes*
