# Ethereum - Layer 2 rollups

Exorbitant gas fees on Ethereum has made transacting on Ethereum extremely expensive. It is imperative to scale up Ethereum so that gas fees are reasonable for everyone to use. However, we are faced with the scalability trilemma when attempting to improve Ethereum scalability, where we have to achieve the right balance between 1) decentralisation, 2) scalability and 3) security.

- Optimism and Arbitrum are two of the L2 solutions that have been launched. However, fees on Arbitrum are still substantial when compared to alternative L1s such as Avalanche, BSC.
